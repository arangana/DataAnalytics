<h3>Disgruntled citizen arrested at scene of explosion</h3>

<p>Anthony Stanton, a local vagrant, was picked up in the vicinity of the mysterious explosion and detained by police. Stanton did not deny the charges that he caused the explosion that reduced three rivers stadium to rubble. He said in a prepared statement that after so many years of losing major league baseball and football teams, it seemed like the most merciful thing to do.</p>

<blockquote>"These guys don't need a stadium to play in, I think they would do better at virtual sports anyway. I have already built them a new stadium in Second Life, as long as they do not mind playing as Neanderthals"</blockquote>

<p>Throughout his arranment, Stanton showed no remorse. When offered the opportunity to plea not guilty by reason of insanity, he claimed it was the most sane thing he had ever done.</p>
